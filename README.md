# AirBnB Clone Part 2

For this lab, you will be creating a clone of AirBnB - a modern booking platform for local bed and breakfasts. This competitor application will be geared towards celebrities only, in the hopes of attracting the highest revenue customers to the platform. Celebrities should be able to sign up, list any of their personal residences, and let other celebrities book trips to stay in their houses.

This lab we'll work on constructing a more robust front-end architecture to help manage complexity in a React application. We'll cover advanced concepts in React and build on our ability to create production-grade React apps.
